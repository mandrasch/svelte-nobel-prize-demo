# Svelte Nobel Prize Demo

Search & filter demo with Svelte v5 & SvelteKitðŸ§™

Demo: https://svelte-nobel-prize-demo.pages.dev

Static site generation via [adapter-static](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapter-static).

## Why?

I like sites such as https://devjobs.at/teams/search, but I think they can be improved with a more "stack-focused" user interface for web developers. Since I wanted to learn the new $state system of Svelte v5 anyway, I started by implementing this. One of the goals is to show how simple a reactive user interface can be implemented with Svelte.
